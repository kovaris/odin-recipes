        <h2 class="pasta-h2">Description</h2>
        <p class="pasta-p">This meaty pasta recipe is delicious and super easy to make.  I use a high quality store bought sauce for convenience and even more simplicity.  Feel free to change up your protein if you fancy.  I prefer ground beef but have had success with grilled chicken and even ground turkey in the past.</p>

        <h3 class="pasta-h2">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="pasta-ul">
            <li><b>Alcohol</b> of your choosing</li>
            <li>1-2 lbs of <b>Ground Beef</b> (80%/20% for the tasty fat) (can be substituted for your choice of protein)</li>
            <li>1/2 box of your choice of <b>Pasta</b> (experiment with different kinds for poops and giggles)</li>
            <li>1 jar of <b>Pasta Sauce</b> (I only ever use Raos Arrabiata.  Highly recommend.)</li>
            <li>1 <b>Bell Pepper</b> (Red, Green, Yellow, or Orange.  Take your pick)</li>
            <li>1 <b>Onion</b> (I like red, but any onion should work just fine)</li>
            <li>1-3 cloves of <b>Garlic</b> (add as much or as little as you want; cant go wrong with garlic)</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b> (to taste)</li>
            <li><b>Pepper</b> (to taste)</li>
            <li><b>Shredded Cheese</b> (Cheddar, Parmesan, Mozza, Parmegiano Reggiano, etc)(to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="pasta-h2">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="pasta-ul">
            <li>Start drinking.  I like to crack open a nice double IPA to get the process started.  Sometimes its a glass of wine and other times its a glass of whiskey.  All of the time its a good time.  This step can be revisited as many times as necessary.  Note: revisiting more times than necessary may affect the final product.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with enough water to make your 1/2 box of pasta: use your best judgement on the amount needed.  Wait for it to boil, add a few pinches of salt, then toss in your pasta.  Boil for 8-10 minutes or until <i>al dente</i>.  You can continue onto the next step while waiting for the water to boil.</li>
            <li>Grab your onion, bell pepper, and cloves of garlic and cut them up.  I prefer to chop them up into little cubes so that they can mix in better with the sauce in later steps.  Place in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Drain your pasta and set aside.</li>
            <li>Toss your meat into a large pan and heat on medium until the meat browns all the way and is swimming in its own juicy fat juices.  During this step you can season your meat with salt and pepper and your preferred spices to taste.</li>
            <li>Now drain that fat!  I like to put a lid on the pan and off-center it a bit so that the fat can drain without spilling all that meaty goodness.  It takes some finessing, but ensures that you don't dump all your ground beef into the sink (ask me how I know).  If you skip this step your final product will be too oily.</li>
            <li>After safely draining your meat, toss in the veggies you cut up earlier.  Season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly.  Heat under medium heat until veggies are soft and juicy (about 10 min), stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat and add your sauce.  Mix thoroughly and simmer until its reduced to the consistency of your liking (I prefer mine a little thicker), stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>When you're happy with the consistency of your meaty sauce, you can add in the pasta you made from earlier.  Making half a box of pasta will generally yield more than enough, so add in as much or as little as you prefer.  Stir, stir, stir.</li>
            <li>Your meaty pasta is nearly done!  Time for the finishing touches:  Sprinkle with a generous portion of a shredded cheese of your choosing and cover.  Let stand covered under low heat for several minutes to allow the cheese to melt all over the surface of your creamy pasta.</li>
            <li>Once your cheese is melty and gooey, you can chow down.  Pairs nicely with a fresh, crisp green salad, garlic bread, and a nice bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
