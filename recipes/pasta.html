    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This meaty pasta recipe is delicious and super easy to make.  I use a high quality store bought sauce for convenience and even more simplicity.  Feel free to change up your protein if you fancy.  I prefer ground beef but have had success with grilled chicken and even ground turkey in the past.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 lbs of <b>Ground Beef</b> (80%/20% for the tasty fat) (can be substituted for your choice of protein)</li>
        <li>1/2 box of your choice of <b>Pasta</b> (experiment with different kinds for poops and giggles)</li>
        <li>1 jar of <b>Pasta Sauce</b> (I only ever use Raos Arrabiata.  Trust me, bro)</li>
        <li>1 <b>Bell Pepper</b> (Red, Green, Yellow, or Orange.  Take your pick)</li>
        <li>1 <b>Onion</b> (I like red, but any onion should work just fine)</li>
        <li>1-3 cloves of <b>Garlic</b> (add as much or as little as you want; cant go wrong with garlic)</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b> (to taste)</li>
        <li><b>Pepper</b> (to taste)</li>
        <li><b>Shredded Cheese</b> (Cheddar, Parmesan, Mozza, Parmegiano Reggiano, etc)(to taste)</li>
