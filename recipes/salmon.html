    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This salmon recipe is super tasty, simple, and won't take all day to prepare, making it a standout dinner candidate for a busy weeknight.  If you're using frozen salmon, allocate at least another half and hour to defrost your fish.  Simply submerge it under cold water for at least 30 minutes until its no longer frozen.  After 30 minutes I like to replace my water with room temperature water to ensure the salmon is thoroughly thawed and closer to room temp, which will allow it to cook more evenly.  After all is said and done, your final product will yield a succulent salmon steak with a crispy outside and flaky middle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alcohol</b> of your choosing</li>
        <li>2-4 <b>Salmon</b> steaks (defrost if frozen)</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>, to taste</li>
        <li><b>Pepper</b>, to taste</li>
        <li>other <b>Spices/Herbs</b> (optional) (we will be using <i>Herbes de Provence</i> and <i>Cedar Plank Seasoning</i> in this example)</li>
        <li>your choice of <b>Cooking Oil</b></li>
        <li>1/4 stick of <b>Butter</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour yourself a drink of your alcoholic beverage and relax while you contemplate your life for a bit.  Preheat your non-stick pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Rinse your fish.  This is largely optional, but I like to do it to get rid of the overbearing fishy smell/taste that can accumulate on the fish while its marinading in its own juices in its pre-packaged form.  Plus, if it still has the skin on, this step ensures that you remove the scales and anything else that shouldn't be on there.  You can also gently feel for bones while you're rinsing and remove any lingering ones to avoid a nasty surprise later on.  After rinsing, pat your fish dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Once dry, you can season up your steaks.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, herbes de provence, and cedar plank seasoning to your liking.  Depending on how thick your steaks are, I would generally recommend being fairly generous with your salt, especially if you have skin-on steaks since you're basically only seasoning one side.</li>
        <li>Your pan should be hot and ready to go by now.  Drizzle some oil in there and toss in your butter.  Once the butter melts, lay down your salmon (skin side up if you have skin on yours).  Leave undisturbed for 5 minutes for the outside to get nice and crispy.</li>
        <li>Salmon cooks pretty quickly, so turn it over after about 5 minutes and assess whether you're satisfied with the crispiness of the outside.  If so, lay skin side down and let cook for a few more minutes, until desired done-ness is reached.  Fish cooks fairly quickly so be mindful of not drying it out.</li>
        <li>Turn off your heat and gently plate your fish.  You're done!  Take a step back and appreciate your work.</li>
        <li>Serve with mashed potatoes and a nice Cobb salad.  Easy, simple, healthy, and delicious!  You deserve another drink.</li>
