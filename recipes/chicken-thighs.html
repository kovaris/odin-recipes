    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I tend to find chicken thighs more interesting than chicken breasts.  The tender, juicy, dark meat...the crispy skin on the outside...theres just so much more going on compared to regular ol' chicken breasts.  Now you can try them for yourself with this easy, fool-proof recipe.  Full disclosure:  you will need a large cast iron pan that is already pre-seasoned and ready for use.  If your pan has not been pre-seasoned, the chicken skin will adhere to the pan and you're going to have a bad time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alcohol</b> of your choosing</li>
        <li>4-5 <b>Chicken Thighs</b> (Bone-in, skin-on)</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of <b>Butter</b></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of <b>Cooking Oil</b> (we will be using <i>avocado oil</i> here)</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b> (to taste)</li>
        <li><b>Pepper</b> (to taste)</li>
        <li><b>Cayenne Pepper</b> (to taste)</li>
        <li><b>Dried Herbs</b> (to taste) (we will be using Herbs de Provence here)</li>
        <li><b>Cumin</b> (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip out your alcoholic beverage and start drinking.  You will be revisiting this step periodically throughout your cooking journey.  For the purpose of this recipe, we will be enjoying a nice glass of 12 year old Scotch.  Please note: revisiting this step too many times may affect the quality of the final product.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350-370F.  The main idea here is low and slow.  We want a nice low temp and a longer cook time in order to allow the cartilage and bone marrow within the chicken thighs to slowly break down and impart its flavors into the meat without drying it out.  The bone will also help to prevent drying by insulating the meat from the inside out, hence why the bone-in chicken thighs are preferred.  Its nearly impossible to dry out these thighs.</li>
        <li>Trim up your chicken skins.  This step is optional, but I like to do it for aesthetic purposes.  The thighs just look better when the skin perfectly drapes over only one side of the thighs without any unnecessary overlap or overhang.  Save yourself some cleanup time by trimming them up right in the cast iron pan.  Discard your trimmings.</li>
        <li>Arrange your thighs in the cast iron pan and drizzle with your cooking oil.  Turn them over a couple times to make sure they are well covered and the bottom of your pan has a nice <em>thin</em> layer of oil.</li>
        <li>Turn your thighs skin side up and season them up with salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, dried herbs, and cumin.  There is no set amount to any of the spices and they can all be exchanged for spices of your preference, so feel free to go wild.  Turn them skin-side down and season up the other side to make sure they are fully coated with your spice mix.</li>
        <li>Now cut a half-inch thick piece of butter and lay it down on your meat; one per thigh.  Remember, your thighs should be laying skin-side down, so as the butter melts, it will coat the top and then trickle down to the bottom to help flavor and crisp up the skin.</li>
        <li>Your oven should be preheated by now, so toss these suckers in!  Middle rack, uncovered, for about 45-60 minutes.  Turn over and allow to cook for an additional 15 minutes or so until the skin crisps up to your liking.</li>
        <li>Pull them out of the oven and take some pics for the 'gram or send them to your loved ones to make them jealous.  Remember to take them out of the cast iron pan otherwise they will keep cooking:  the pan is hot!  Let them rest for a few minutes to allow the juices the settle and then chow down.  Pairs well with rice and a salad of your choosing.</li>
